Microsoft P4VFS Release Notes

Version [1.29.3.0]
* Perforce SSO login from URL now uses impersonated p4vfs login command and ShellExecute 
  instead of using cmd.exe. This fix rare case lingering cmd.exe processes from failed launch 
  of the browser when there's no desktop session. This also prevents cmd.exe 
  with inherited handles, including TCP ports, from remaining open after service
  is stopped and possibly causing failed port reopening after reinstall.
* Added option 'login -u <url>' for handling login challenge in web browser
* Added option 'login -t <seconds>' for timeout of login command before self
  termination. This offers safety from possible lingering interactive prompts.

Version [1.29.2.0]
* Replacing authentication for public driver codesign from Hardware Development 
  Center from deprecated client secret to x509 certificate. This is similar to 
  the PRSS codesign authentication and is generally more secure.

Version [1.29.1.0]
* Fixing bug where log output would not be written to the local log file if remote
  logging was enabled and writting to the remote log file had failed.
* Fixing undesirable behavior in 1.29.0.0 where all attribute change directory notifications
  from file hydration were suppressed. This could even prevent windows explorer from
  showing offline attribute (icon) change without having to refresh. This fix now 
  allows one attribute change notification when hydration is complete.
* Addition of common Windows Defender process names to default ExcludedProcessNames, 
  instead of having to rely on a custom local configuration to exclude these. Recent
  WD signatures have been aggressively ignoring Offline attribute and sniffing "larger"
  file-types (FBX,MA,SPP) making this almost essential.
* Addition of `-a` to `print` command used for file hydration. This can be a significant 
  perforce server side optimization allowing lockless reads when db.peeking=2 or 3.
  https://portal.perforce.com/s/article/3839
* Updating to OpenSSL from 3.3.1 to 3.3.3. Now building with `no-apps` to which very 
  slightly reduces build time

Version [1.29.0.0]
* Fixing virtual file hydration to be excluded from system directory notifications.
  This avoids unecessary FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION or DirectoryWatcher events indicating
  a virtual file has been modified, when it's only been hydrated as-expected on read.
  This technique is common across filter drivers. This is only supported for STREAM 
  populate method (default). New unit test TestReadDirectoryChanges for verification.  
* Additional unit test varible P4VFS_TEST_SERVER_ROOT for overriding the root directory
  for the test servers. This better facilitates running all tests remotely on a local
  virtual machine with including kernel mode debugging. Includes support for 
  RestartPerforceServer script to quick spin-up of existing server on override drive
* Reconfiguring our 32 bit driver allocation pool tags to 4-byte string "Pvs*"
* Fixing bug recieving large messages to/from the P4VFS.Service. This was typically 
  encountered when using global "-x <file>" with a file containing many arguments. 
  There's a new ReflectPackage message which is now used by SocketModelCommunicationTest 
  to stress test a wide range of message sizes
* Fixing unit tests deterministic random byte generation to more randomly include 
  zero as randomly as possible
* Support for additional registry keys to set defined in the setup application configuration
  file (typically named P4VFS.Setup.xml residing in the same folder as the installer).
  This is helpfull for setting possibly setting a version key to indicate what settings
  template was also installed.

Version [1.28.4.0]
* Addition of optional service commandline argument to launch with debugger attached. 
  This is done as needed from admin command prompt "sc.exe start P4VFS.Service --break"
* Moving service logging system to initialize before ExtensionsInterop. This avoids
  missed logging from service communication initialization.

Version [1.28.3.0]
* Fixing service initialization error if registry ImagePath value contains quotes
  under key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P4VFS.Service".
  Including a new unit test to verify handling of user settings paths.
* Updating driver WDK to 10.0.26100

Version [1.28.2.0]
* Fixing support for specifying a value for P4TICKETS from within a P4CONFIG file,
  and correctly used from working directory of p4vfs.exe, or placeholder file folder
  during service hydration. Service requires P4CONFIG set in system environment or
  system registry.

Version [1.28.1.0]
* Fixing possible memory leak during sync operation while accumulating logging 
  elements for statistics

Version [1.28.0.0]
* Addition of 'dehydrate' command as synonym for 'resident -v', for changing existing
  files from #have to zero-byte placeholder files. Unit tests included.
* Fixing support for p4vfsflt driver backwards compatibility for Windows Server 2019 and 
  earlier, including Windows prior to Windows 10 version 2004. This addressed
  down-level compatibility new zeroed allocation API's such as ExAllocatePool2
* Fixing bug causing some perforce sync errors not to be shown when doing a quite
  single mode sync, such as 'populate', or 'sync -q -m Single'
* Update to P4API 2024.1 and OpenSSL 3.3.1. UnitTest now uses p4d.exe/p4.exe 2024.1
* Virtual sync details at the start of sync operation now write to StdOut instead of StdErr

Version [1.27.1.0]
* Now also ignoring specdef tag from P4API results, similar to P4API.NET
* The P4VFS install now configures the driver as allowed by Windows DevDrive, and
  the uninstall will remove this exemption.  
* Additional native unit tests for windows registry utilities and DevDrive installation
* Additional DevDrive unit tests with ReFS virtual hard drive 

Version [1.27.0.0]
* New sync -c option to force the placeholder file size to be the expected workspace 
  file size, instead of server file size. This requires server 2023.1 or later.
* Updating to P4API 2023.2 and OpenSSL 1.1.1v. UnitTest now uses p4d.exe/p4.exe 2023.1
* P4VFS.External checksum verification fix to handle unexpected whitespace around SHA256
* Driver IRP_MJ_CREATE PostCreate callback fix for properly ignoring reparse on non-P4VFS 
  files with FileTag matching our P4VFS_REPARSE_TAG.
* Driver now requires process to be elevated in order to set control parameters (p4vfs ctrl)
* Addition of DepotClient accessor for server protocol level used for testing for server 
  features and unicode behavior
* Additional tests for elevated access requirements for internal p4vfsflt control port 
  operations
* Fixing stdout display of native unit test assertions and other inner assertions
* Fixing bug where "Text" would appear at the top of the Setup details output.
* Additional tests for both internal ClientSize sync API and p4vfs sync -c

Version [1.26.1.0]
* Fixing support for file paths including non-ASCII single-byte (CP-1252) encoded characters.
  Additional unit test for handling file paths containing common french accent marks.
* Fixing execution of remote unit tests requiring an installed p4.exe instead of using
  the included P4VFS external binaries

Version [1.26.0.0]
* Driver using officially allocated FSFilter HSM altitude of 189700
* Refactor of perforce client login operations to support common forms of password and
  SSO login. This includes password auth, classic P4LOGINSSO client script auth, and server 
  auth extensions such as Helix Authentication Service.
* Fixing service process launch as impersonated user to include the user's profile environment.
  This allows the service's interactive password prompt, or browser authentication, to execute
  with expected user environment variables.

Version [1.25.1.0]
* Addition of new "hydrate" command as synonym for "resident -x". Moved the implementation into
  C++ and now using a single fstat command instead of a files & where command.
* Moving native thread pool utilites for system limits into shared location
* Addition of native parallel directory traversal utility and new TestIterateDirectoryParallel
  unit test to verify correctness. Implementation allows both the directory traversal, as well 
  as the visitation, to be done across multiple threads. This will be used for sweeping operations 
  including hydrating and reconfiguring files recursively.
* Addition of new service setting "PoolDefaultNumberOfThreads" to customize the default number
  of thread pool threads for concurrent operations, such as a virtual sync.
* Native test factory now displays both skipped and executed tests, similar to Managed factory.
* Major refactor to managed interface for native SettingManager which fixes missing new 
  properties being serialized in configuration files, and reported in 'p4vfs set'. Managed property
  code generation now moved into C++ to remove duplication.
* Addition of service tick thread for performing garbage collection on cached DepotClient 
  connections. Two new settings GarbageCollectPeriodMs & DepotClientCacheIdleTimeoutMs can be 
  configured to remove lingering (cached) connections at a certain frequency and life-time.
* Addition of user settings file locations for allowing incremental overrides of installed settings.
  Settings files are now loaded in order (with UserSettingsFilePath loaded last)
    1. InstalledSettingsFilePath    - C:\Program Files\P4VFS\P4VFS.Settings.xml
                                      This is most common installed settings file
    2. AssemblySettingsFilePath     - <directory of p4vfs.exe or P4VFS.Service.exe>\P4VFS.Settings.xml
                                      Primarily used for custom unit test run settings
    3. PublicSettingsFilePath       - %PUBLIC%\P4VFS.Settings.xml
                                      Shared user location for both p4vfs and service
    4. UserSettingsFilePath         - %USERPROFILE%\P4VFS.Settings.xml
                                      Different for p4vfs.exe and non-impersonated service
* Addition of DepotClientCacheIdleTimeoutTest which verifies correct operation of service 
  garbage collection frequency and behavior
* Adding timestamps to version headers in release notes P4VFS.Notes.txt
* Addition of `p4vfs reconfig` command to modify the perforce configuration of local 
  placeholder files. Includes options for limiting which configuration variable to apply. 
  This is commonly used to change files in an existing workspace to use a different 
  perforce server endpoint (ie, a different broker or proxy server) without requiring a 
  force sync #have
* Fixing bug where resident command doesn't correctly support quiet logging (#23). Additional
  unit test to verify -q option works correctly for commands that support it.

Version [1.25.0.0] 2023/03/23
* Updated drivers for VS 2022 and WDK 10.0.22621.382

Version [1.24.2.0] 2023/03/19

  speeds up the Contains ops in the last loop of DepotOperations::SyncCommand. @belkiss
* Fixing test FileAttributeTest for handling possible NotContentIndexed attribute @belkiss
* Removing UnitTest EventSourceAnalyzer dependency and cleanup of EventSource trace
  support and tests

Version [1.24.1.0] 2023/03/12
* Adding simple verify pipeline for running on GitHub hosted runners which has required
  some library updates, for the best. Full CI/CD pipelines remain in internal Microsoft
  DevOps for codesign purposes.
* Updating to Visual Studio 2022 (17.5.1). Platform toolset v143. MSVC Redist 14.34.31931

  https://github.com/microsoft/p4vfs

Version [1.23.7.0] 2023/03/05
* Fixes to use signed driver binaries from restored P4VFS module in Dev builds
* Fixing driver codesign verfication unit test to check built WDK sign, P4VFS module
  production sign, and current installer
* Additional support to remove existing WDKTest signature from driver binaries before
  submitting to HDC for attestation sign.
* Fixing p4d.exe & p4.exe references in unit tests to use binaries from P4API external 
  module directly instead of resource

Version [1.23.6.0] 2023/01/21
* Addition of External P4VFS module which restores an extracted nuget package containing
  targeted signed binaries. This replaces the signed driver binaries in the repo folder
  "P4VFS.Driver/Signed" which have now been removed.
* P4VFS.Setup application now supports an "extract" command to simply extract it 
  installation resources to a folder
* Build support for overriding codesign method from msbuild property.

Version [1.23.5.0] 2022/11/27
* Modified OpenSSL codesign to use OSS 3rd party keycode.
* P4VFS.CodeSign change for kernel mode binaries to use a two stage codesign. The ESRP 
  submission with EV certificate, followed by production HDC verification and sign.
* P4VFS driver codesign now uses production attestation codesign from HDC, which works 
  for Windows 10, 11, Server 2016, Server 2019. This will be replaced by HDC WHQL signing 
  to include support for Server 2022
* Addition of P4VFS.Driver.WDKTest certificate for test codesign of driver, which is now
  used by default. For HDK automated testing, as well as local signed driver debugging, 
  utilities have been added under "P4VFS.Driver\Scripts" to install & uninstall the driver 
  and setup trust for the test codesign
* Addition of configurations for various codesign methods used for driver signing from 
  P4VFS.CodeSign tool. Pipelines may use different methods based on release requirements.

Version [1.23.4.0] 2022/11/19
* Addition of P4VFS.External project for automatically downloading and building external
  project references, such as OpenSSL adn P4API, as part of the solution build. This
  is analogous to a nuget "restore" operatation, but for non-packaged references. Prebuilt
  binaries from these external projects have been removed from the repository.
* Cleanup and reorganization of some utilities in P4VFS.Extensions to allow for sharing
  with P4VFS.External

Version [1.23.2.0] 2022/09/14
* Fixing service hydration performing automatic p4 trust of server SSL certificate when 
  fingerprint changes. This is common when rolling over server SSL certification.
* Addition of unit test for intended automatic trust behaviour when encountering new 
  or different certificates.
* Fixing remote execution unit tests to confirm remote executing user also has an active
  logon session. This is required by P4VFS to properly cache tickets and trust. P4VFS
  behaviour is otherwise not confirmed.

Version [1.23.1.0] 2022/08/10
* Removing legacy studio specific settings files. Adding instructions for deployment
  procedures and example usage in new files under P4VFS.Setup\Settings
* Removing miscelaneous test user credentials from RestartPerforceServer.bat utility,
  which is used to quickly restart the previous unittest server
* Adding write accessors to DepotResult classes for easier use of results as input for commands
* Addition of p4vfs unit test support to duplicate test server on another port with/without
  SSL enabled. Test test verify server duplication operation works as expected.
* The DepotServerConfig option to resolve/remap a server name by regex has been changed
  to a case insensitive match

Version [1.23.0.0] 2022/06/03
* Fixing driver FltCreateCommunicationPort client handle leak
* Improving P4VFS.Driver TraceStart & TraceStop scripts so that they can be run
  standalone outside Visual Studio environment

Version [1.22.0.0] 2022/03/08
* Fixing bug where P4VFS could possibly hydrate incorrect alternate or metadata NTFS
  stream. Driver now ignores reparse actions on any possible alternate or metadata
  streams in P4VFS placeholder files if any were to exist.
* Updating to C++17 and fixing deprecation issues
* Fixing bug with Error/Warning summary not displaying correctly and consistently between
  regular and virtual sync
* Cleanup of ExtensionsInterop project dependencies to only use Extensions assembly
* Fixing p4vfs.exe exit code to return non-zero value depending on Warnings/Errors during
  operation. Internal sync API now returns exit code and additional modification information
  as part of the results. Extensive unit testing changes to additionally verify expected exit
  codes and results.
* Fixing Warning/Error output to go to STDERR

Version [1.21.0.0] 2022/02/13
* Updating driver to WDK 10.0.19041.685, SDK 10.0.19041.685, VS 16.11.10
* Updating P4API to 2021.2 using ntx64/p4api_vs2019_dyn*_openssl1.1.1
* Added "external\P4API\Restore.py" which implements the entire process of downloading, 
  checksum verifying, and deploying a new P4API and test binaries
* Updated OpenSSL to latest stable 1.1.1m built with VS 16.11.10
* Added "external\OpenSSL\Restore.py" which implements the entire process of downloading, 
  checksum verifying, building debug & release, testing, and deploying a new OpenSSL
* Updating driver p4vfsflt.inf with build architecture specific target
* Fixing driver uninstall to manually perform required unloading before setupapi 
  DefaultUninstall, for maximum compatibility
* Adding new option '-d' to P4VFS.Setup to support automatically launching attached
  debugger to internal p4vfs.exe calls.
* Fixing default impersonated P4HOST value used for initial connection. This avoids a
  Windows 11 error using deprecated gethostname. 

Version [1.20.4.0] 2021/03/19
* Updated targets to 4.7.2 with v142 build tools for Visual Studio 2019. 
  Now requires Visual Studio 2019 to build.

Version [1.20.3.0] 2022/01/21
* Fixing bug occuring when failing to virtual sync a file that is opened by another 
  process, resulting in the file being left as writable [BUG 37857]
* Reducing non-verbose output in service log for file resolving [BUG 25274]
* Addition of unit test to expose bug leaving writable file after failing to sync
* Addition of API for tunning internal perforce client debug configuration values
* Fixing minor unit testing failures when testing on Windows 11
* Perforce client API ProgramName now includes P4VFS version, ie "<app>/1.20.3.0"

Version [1.20.2.0] 2021/09/03
* Interactive install setup window support for resizing expanded output text

Version [1.20.1.0] 2021/08/13
* Addition of "p4vfs resident" options [-q] to force a quiet sync, and [-l] to force 
  regular logging. Default behaviour controled by SyncDefaultQuiet setting
* Removing unit test references to northamerica\jessk
* Updating build system to EsrpClient 1.2.65

Version [1.20.0.0] 2021/04/04
* Addition of driver trace start/stop scripts for logging during tests
* Driver filter now handles IRP_MJ_FILE_SYSTEM_CONTROL to hydrate a placeholder 
  when an OPLOCK is requested on the handle. The driver will perform handle creation 
  for the service hydration to avoid access violations. This fixes the OPLOCK
  deadlock on placeholder files discovered from Entrian Source Search. 
* Renaming DriverCommunication.h to DriverData.h and cleanup unecessary includes
* Removing all use of crt references from driver
* Addition of support for Perforce SSO (single sign on) login. The majority of these
  changes are enhancements to unit testing for login cases. The configuration of local 
  Perforce test server changed to support both Perforce passsword auth and SSO auth.
  Client side tests added for login permutations. Addition of automated testing for 
  interactive login prompt operations.
* Fixing bug where perforce login operation may not correctly read environment variables
  unique to the current process. This may have included process overridden values of
  P4TRUST or P4TICKETS variables.
* Addition of unit test helper script for quick Perforce server restart and login.
* Addition of common utility and test for user mode P4VFS_UNICODE_STRING creation
* Addition of unit test which aquires OPLOCK and performs asyncronous reads which will
  reproduce the error similar to that exposed by Entrian Source Search. Currently fails.
* ReleaseSign configuration now signs all embedded resources including driver files
* Fixing bug where internal FileAttributes query required FILE_GENERIC_READ access
  when it should not require any FILE_* access to read BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION
* P4VFS.Setup now supports an optional application config XML file for customizing 
  installation settings. This allows us to install custom global studio settings without 
  having to build a custom installer. The config file must be placed in the same folder
  as the installer and similarly named.
* Addition of driver control command option to set driver flag by name using 
  p4vfs.exe ctrl -f <name>=<value>
* Addition of driver flag "ShareModeDuringHydration" which forces file handle creation 
  during hydration have read/write share mode, which is a legacy requirement that we
  we intend to remove now that the driver performs handle creation on P4VFS
  placeholder files.
* Rename of P4VFS.DriverSign project to P4VFS.CodeSign because it's now generally
  used to sign all binaries, not just the driver
* P4VFS.Setup application now launches as Aministrator from the shell if possible. The
  installer now also checks if elevated before elevating itself.

Version [1.19.3.0] 2021/02/05
* Updating to P4API 2020.1, and OpenSSL 1.1.1k and included detailed build 
  and deployment steps for future updates.
* Fixing bug with inconsisent vtable layout with some P4API classes between P4VFS 
  and P4API due to P4VFS missing define of OS_NT.

Version [1.19.2.0] 2021/02/02
* Adding Entrian Source Search (ess.exe) to ExcludedProcessNames by default as a 
  temporary work-around for OPLOCK related deadlock.

Version [1.19.1.0] 2021/01/19
* Fixing bug introduced in 1.19.0.0 where creating a directory from a UNC path 
  would always fail. This bug would prevent remote log files from being created if
  FileLoggerRemoteDirectory setting specified a UNC path.

Version [1.19.0.0] 2020/12/21
* Adding long path aware support throughout P4VFS to generally support paths
  exceeding MAX_PATH in length. Internal file operations now support a maximum 
  path length of 32767 characters. Limitations of an NTFS reparse point max size 
  of 16384 bytes will constrain supported P4VFS depot paths to roughly 8100 characters, 
  depending on accumulated length of p4port, p4client, and p4user strings
  within the reparse point. The P4VFS reparse point data format has is now changed 
  to support variable, minimal sized unicode strings thus reducing most common
  reparse point sizes on disk while also allowing very large paths.
* New reparse point format changes maximum perforce FileRevision from 16^2 to 32^2
* Now targeting .NET Framework 4.6.2 for addition managed longPathAware support
* Removal of native shellapi.dll dependencies not supporting long paths
* Additional unit tests for verifying long path support, including new server files
* Additional unit tests of user mode compilation and testing of driver utilities. The
  core P4VFS driver utilities can now be elaborately tested as part of P4VFS.UnitTest
* Additional unit test for compatibility of files synced using a legacy version of P4VFS.
  This helps ensure new driver and service compatibility with older reparse data.
* Adding P4VFS.natvis debugging visualizer for display of P4VFS_UNICODE_STRING used
  throughout reparse data and driver/service communication
* P4VFS.Setup adding a short time for retrying folder deletion to fix possible race 
  deleting folders after executing applications within it
* Native unit tests now show execution name in console title, similar to managed tests
* Memory sizes displayed in sync stats now also shown as major unit (KB,MB,GB,TB)
* Profile times displayed in sync stats now also show hour, min, sec, ms, breakdown.
* P4VFS.Core now compiling with Level 4 warnings

Version [1.18.11.0] 2020/10/25
* Significantly improved p4vfs.exe startup time by excluding the log header from
  local log files, and now only adds header to remote log files.
* Fixing obscure error message running p4vfs.exe info command when service not running
* Fixing testing support for ReleaseSign configuration to use final signed binaries

Version [1.18.10.0] 2020/10/21
* Fixing intermitent unit testing errors from missing Etw processes to exclude
* Moved remainder of p4vfs.exe test execution procedure into UnitTest assembly

Version [1.18.9.0] 2020/10/14
* Fixing support for specifying revision ranges in filespecs. Added testing to
  verify complex revision range usage.
* Fixing case where perforce login could fail when populating a file in which the
  workspace owner has changed and an expired ticket exists for the previous user. 
  Attempting login using new workspace owner may possibly use the expired ticket.
* Removing default host configuration from remote unit testing to further decouple
  references to The Coalition

Version [1.18.8.0] 2020/08/17
* Optimizing major sync performance bottlenecks from innerloops with c++ regex's.
  This significantly reduces the pre-sync time for large syncs.

Version [1.18.7.0] 2020/07/30
* Fixing error handling in p4vfs resident command from when a specified path
  does not exist or is invalid
* Addition of unit test to verify expected installation of signed binaries
* Publish setup script now uses common DevOps Release pipeline target

Version [1.18.6.0] 2020/07/26
* Addition of build configuration ReleaseSign for ESRP signing all binaries. 
  Internal P4VFS builds from The Coalition now have all solution binaries and
  installer signed by a Microsoft Root Authority for external use. Future DevOps
  releases will also be likewise signed.

Version [1.18.5.0] 2020/07/18
* Removing dependency on fltmc.exe and replacing with some simple win32 calls
  inside P4VFS.Core. This allows removing more P4VFS.ExtensionsInterop interfaces.
  Added unit test verifying driver loading & unloading

Version [1.18.4.0] 2020/07/07
* Fixing flickering progress dialogs during driver installation process. This
  was also potentially hazardous because these dialogs could except input to 
  interupt the installation. The driver install moved to native code and now 
  dynamically loads setupapi.dll instead of calling out to rundll.exe

Version [1.18.3.0] 2020/07/04
* Fixing failure during reinstallation if a p4vfs service handle is open by an
  external application. Typically if services.msc or Process Explorer is 
  monitoring the P4VFS.Service, it will hold an open SC_HANDLE to the service.
  In this case, the uninstall could leave the service as marked-for-delete, and
  cause a later install to fail, until the external handle is closed. There 
  is new unit test for this case.
* Addition of "p4vfs populate" command which is Synonym for 'sync -q -m Single'
  This is the fastest method of populating a workspace, however if terminated
  before completion it will result in inconsistent files.
* DriverSign application now supports downloading EsrpClient package on-demand
  using nuget.exe
* Migrated all projects packages.config to PackageReferences

Version [1.18.2.0] 2020/06/21
* Fixing "quiet single flush" virtual sync [-q -m Single] behaviour which was 
  terribly broken in native implimentation. This permutation was missing unit 
  tests, and have now been added as well.
* Fixing service shutdown request cancel any sync operation in progress and 
  exit cleanly instead of possibly timing out.
* Cleanup of LogDevice interface so that it's simple to know how to extend

Version [1.18.1.0] 2020/06/17
* Significant change to interactive login prompt behaviour. Interactive login
  from service will not be prompted, and blocked, if the calling process is a
  common system account. This will likely include refusing login prompts for 
  windows defender and windows telemetry file accesses.

Version [1.18.0.0] 2020/06/14
* Driver tracing refactor to adopt standard WPP usage, and remove support for 
  sending driver trace messages to service. This allows us to safely log messages
  at any IRQL, and remove potentially hazardous string formating operations in
  the driver. Control of tracing using "p4vfs ctrl -dt <level>" has been removed.
  A p4vfsflt WPP trace format file is now generated on compilation and is included
  with installation. This now allows us view trace logs from signed drivers.

Version [1.17.0.0] 2020/06/11
* Driver change to disable WPP trace by default. This improves performance and 
  prevents a possible PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bugcheck in logging code at
  IRQL >= APC_LEVEL. Tracing can still be enabled manually using the "p4vfs ctrl -dt <level>" 
  command. Logging code will be properly fixed in next release.

Version [1.16.0.0] 2020/05/24
* Fixing all Static Driver Verifier warnings from function calls at IRQL. This

  from remote log files.

Version [1.12.2.0] 2020/02/15
* The p4vfs sync now uses native code path with P4API instead of P4API.NET
  by default. There is an additional sync option [-c] to perform the operation
  using the legacy managed code path.

* Fixing sync operation to not stop after the first file operation error, and 
  instead continue syncing remaining files as it did before version 1.11.14
* Restoring previous behaviour of the Single flush type to perform the p4 flush
  operation before making local client file changes. This can significantly 
  improve performance when syncing many files
* Now supporting caching and reuse of native DepotClient connections which
  will improve performance of STREAM populate method
* Default FlushType changed from Single back to Atomic to provide the "safe to
  terminate" sync by default. However, this default option is typically overridden

  [-l] to force regular logging during sync (ie. not-quiet)
* The remote and local file logging paths are now optional and can be configured
  and/or disabled through the service settings
* Setup project now has user build configuration support for including optional

  placeholder files. Currently supported for individual file queries (IRP_MJ_QUERY_INFORMATION
  and IRP_MJ_NETWORK_QUERY_OPEN) but not yet for directory listings (IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL)
  In most cases this will be sufficient (such as from GetFileAttributes) but somewhat
  confusing when looking at attributes from directory listings (FindFirstFile)
